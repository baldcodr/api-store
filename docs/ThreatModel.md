# Threat Model

This document provides a basic threat model for the API Store application.
A threat model is a structured approach used to identify, assess, and mitigate potential security threats to a system or application. The goal is to understand and address the security risks that could negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

We will be using the STRIDE methodology for our thread model which focuses on: 
Spoofing, 
Tampering, 
Repudiation, 
Information Disclosure, 
Denial of Service, and 
Elevation of Privilege.
